            <p>LUDIO is an interactive learning platform, designed
               for children with ASD to encourage turn taking and
               reduce reliance on screened devices.

                The platform combines a smartphone application and physical toy for
                at least two players to practice patient reciprocation. Its
                unique shape combines physical action with digital
                interactivity to keep autistic students calm and engaged.
